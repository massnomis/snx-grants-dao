## research-on-snx-intrest-rates:

## Description: 
- I propose to do a reseach study to understand and propose better intrest rate models for SNX on decentralized money markets and push through proposals in the respective governance systems 
## Motivation: 
-Currently in the decentralized money market ecospace, there has been a lack of academic research done on the underlying intrest rate models. There are three different models; linear, non linear and kinked. However, there is research suggesting a revamp of these models, especially for a token like SNX, which has inherent value deriving from its staking. Because of its addtional functanality, aditional research needs to be done to find and propose an ideal model for lending and borrwoing.

## Previous work:

## Estimated hours: 
- 5-10 hours planning, getting data, additional research
- 5-10 hours writing
- 5-7 hours showcasing repor to my proffesors, industry profesionals, SNX and other relavant teams

- Total: 15-27 hours of all types of work

## Price (SNX): 
 
- 1800 SNX 
- (I would prefer to receive escrowed SNX, It is my understanding that this is not required, howver I belive that this is a fair process and would love to set a precedent)
- (Less selling, higher price)
